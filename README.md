# Citograph

Citograph is an open source tool for visualizing and exploring citations and references between sources. It allows you to search Semantic Scholar's database for academic papers and extract citation data from them, generating a JSON file representing the graph of citations and references between the selected papers. This JSON file can then be passed to Excalidraw to render the citation graph as a diagram.
